The source project is https://github.com/zhedongzheng/finch. Because I just want to focus to the tensorflow models and pytorch models,
so I do not fork the project directly. Futhermore, I fixed some bugs in previous project and change the architecture.

**Note**: Some test code need the data exists, so you need to change the file path in source code to your data path.

There are these algorithms in the tensorflow-models:
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- SVM
- Autoencoder (MLP based and CNN based)
- NMF
- GAN
- Conditional GAN
- DCGAN
- CNN
- RNN (for classification and for regression)
- Highway network (MLP based)
